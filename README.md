# Cheat sheets

My personal cheat sheets.

## Building and configuration

Requires pandoc, LaTeX and GNU Make.

Change settings in `templates/meta.yml` and/or add code to the header in `templates/header.tex`.

Build using Make:

```
make
```

This will generate a pdf version of the markdown files to the `docs/` folder.
